# Welcome to DNSDig

A weekend project that turns into something semi serious to learn about DNS in Python while investigating what it's like to build an API in 2023 with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) and [DNSPython](https://www.dnspython.org/). Authentication and authorization is handled by [Kinde](https://kinde.com).

## Why Build This?
